# python-textgame
Just to get this off my chest, i'm currently 12 years old and don't know any advanced things in python.
a text game im currently working on. Very basic and primitive. Will probably piss alot of programmers off.
Its not much andisn't really complicated but it's a start, it also uses different files alot so yeah, give some tips if you will.
Im a starting programmer and i am just trying to test myself and learn new stuff.
it isnt close to finished yet so thats why there are some open ends here and there.
